# Purpose

Santa's Little Helper is an app to help maintain Christmas Lists for the holiday season and to assit in activities, such as office or family Secret Santa. Users will be able to create their own Christmas lists and add/update their wishlists, as well as view the wishlists of other users. Users will create a Username/Password combination to ensure that they are the only person able to edit or delete items on their list. Users will be able to see the items and prices of other users.

# Essential Features

The most important aspect is the multiple tables being edited and created by multiple users. These tables need to be fully accessible to all users for all CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This will require MySQL and Sequelize, as well as Node. Additionally, ensuring that the only person who can update/delete items on a table is the person who created the table (or "admin") will be necessary.
